{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: Give me a summary of the paragraph in your own words and it should be short\nContext: Recreational drug use is the use of one or more psychoactive drugs to induce an altered state of consciousness either for pleasure or for some other casual purpose or pastime. When a psychoactive drug enters the user's body, it induces an intoxicating effect. Generally, recreational drugs are divided into three categories: depressants (drugs that induce a feeling of relaxation and calmness), stimulants (drugs that induce a sense of energy and alertness), and hallucinogens (drugs that induce perceptual distortions such as hallucination).\n\nIn popular practice, recreational drug use generally is a tolerated social behaviour, rather than perceived as the medical condition of self-medication. However, drug use and drug addiction are severely stigmatized everywhere in the world. Many people also use prescribed and controlled depressants such as opioids, as well as opiates and benzodiazepines. What controlled substances are considered generally unlawful to possess varies by country, but usually includes cannabis, cocaine, opioids, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. As of <DATE_TIME>, it is estimated that about 5% of people worldwide aged <DATE_TIME> (158 million to 351 million) had used controlled drugs at least once.\n\nCommon recreational drugs include caffeine, commonly found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and chocolate; alcohol, commonly found in beer, wine, cocktails, and distilled spirits; nicotine, commonly found in tobacco, tobacco-based products, and electronic cigarettes; cannabis and hashish (with legality of possession varying inter\/intra-nationally); and the controlled substances listed as controlled drugs in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (<DATE_TIME>) and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (<DATE_TIME>) of the United Nations (UN). Since <DATE_TIME>, the European Union (EU) has developed several comprehensive and multidisciplinary strategies as part of its drug policy in order to prevent the diffusion of recreational drug use and abuse among the <NRP> population and raise public awareness on the adverse effects of drugs among all member states of the European Union, as well as conjoined efforts with <NRP> law enforcement agencies, such as the Europol and <NRP>, in order to counter organized crime and illegal drug trade in <LOCATION>.","role":"user"},{"content":"Recreational drug use refers to using certain drugs for enjoyment or leisure purposes instead of for medicinal reasons. Some common recreational drugs include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs like ecstasy. While many countries consider recreational drug use legal, there are still laws surrounding their consumption and distribution. The EU has implemented various policies aimed at reducing recreational drug use and addressing issues related to drug trafficking within its borders.\n\nPeople often take recreational drugs because they want to experience feelings of euphoria, increased energy levels, or enhanced sensory perception. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, including dependence, withdrawal symptoms, impaired judgment and motor skills, and even death. Additionally, recreational drug use can lead to legal consequences, financial problems, strained relationships, and health issues such as mental illness, organ damage, and overdose. Despite these risks, many individuals continue to engage in recreational drug use due to peer pressure, stress relief, or simply for the thrill of it. Overall, recreational drug use poses significant dangers to both individual users and society as a whole.","role":"assistant"}]}

For example take the following two statements:\n\nI was chased by the fox, the bear and the dog.\nI was chased by the fox, the bear, and the dog.\n\nThe meaning is the same but the second statement contains an <LOCATION> comma.\n\nSome say the <LOCATION> comma adds clarity to some statements. This is apparent when there can be ambiguity between a list and an appositive. Take the following two example statements:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, <PERSON> and <PERSON>.\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, <PERSON>, and <PERSON>.\n\nThe first statement can appear to imply that we went to dinner with two people whose names are <PERSON> and <PERSON> who are both our coaches. There is no such implication that can be extracted from the second statement. The second statement implies we went to dinner with at least 4 people: <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and at least two coaches. This type of ambiguity is what proponents of the <LOCATION> comma latch onto in its defense.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of the Oxford comma claim it should be avoided in favor of rewording sentences when necessary. The sentence:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, <PERSON>, and <PERSON>.\n\nCan easily be reworded as:\n\nWe went to dinner with <PERSON> and <PERSON>, as well as our coaches.\n\nThe \"as well as\" language is claimed to be more clear than the <LOCATION> comma albeit less concise.

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: here is a blurb about byte pair encoding for encryption, what benefits does this concept have besides compression?\nContext: Byte pair encoding (BPE) or digram coding is a simple and robust form of data compression in which the most common pair of contiguous bytes of data in a sequence are replaced with a byte that does not occur within the sequence. A lookup table of the replacements is required to rebuild the original data. The algorithm was first described publicly by Philip Gage in a <DATE_TIME> article \"A New Algorithm for Data Compression\" in the C Users Journal.\n\nA variant of the technique has shown to be useful in several natural language processing (NLP) domains, for applications such as tokenisation, as seen in Google's SentencePiece and <LOCATION>'s GPT-3. Here, the goal is not data compression, but tokenisation of text in a given language to produce a variable sequence of terms from a fixed-size vocabulary of tokens. Typically, most words will be encoded as a single token, while rare words will be encoded as a sequence of a few tokens, where these tokens represent meaningful word parts. This translation of text into tokens can be found by variants of byte pair encoding, such as subword units.\n\nByte pair encoding lends itself to NLP tasks due to its simplicity and speed; BPE is suitably effective for the tokenisation of terms, does not require large computational overheads, and remains consistent, making it reliable.","role":"user"},{"content":"An alternate use for byte pair encoding besides compression would be tokenization.

With no player taller than 6 feet, 5 inches, the <NRP>' speed and zone press forced 29 turnovers and nullified the height advantage of Duke's <PERSON> and <PERSON>, two 6-foot, 10-inch players.\n\nIn the <DATE_TIME> campaign, the defending NCAA champions got off to an ominous start when UCLA lost to <LOCATION> by 27 points in its opening game. It was all uphill after that as the squad repeated as national champions with <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON>. The <NRP> upended <PERSON> <LOCATION> team 91\u201380 in the finals of the NCAA tournament. Goodrich shared Player of the Year honors with Princeton's <PERSON>. The <DATE_TIME> squad was denied a chance at a triple crown when it finished second to Oregon State in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (now the Pac-12). UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament <DATE_TIME> because in <DATE_TIME> only conference champions received a bid to the tournament. The <NRP><DATE_TIME> incarnation returned with a vengeance with sophomore star <PERSON>, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown with another 30\u20130 season, and then retaining it every season but one until <PERSON>'s retirement immediately following the <DATE_TIME> NCAA championship.\n\nThe resurgence of the <NRP> under <PERSON> made it obvious that they needed a new home. Since <DATE_TIME>, the Bruins had played at the Men's Gym. It normally seated 2,400, but had been limited to 1,500 since <DATE_TIME> by order of the city fire marshal. This forced the <NRP> to move games to Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and other venues around <LOCATION> when they were expected to attract larger crowds\u2014something that happened fairly often after the <NRP>' first national title. At <PERSON>'s urging, a much larger on-campus facility, <LOCATION>, was built in time for <DATE_TIME>. The building in <LOCATION> was christened on <DATE_TIME>, in a special game that pitted the UCLA varsity against the UCLA freshmen. It was <PERSON> (later <PERSON>) <DATE_TIME> (freshmen were ineligible to play on the varsity in <DATE_TIME>). UCLA was the defending national champion and ranked number 1 in <DATE_TIME> poll. The freshmen easily won the game by a score of 75\u201360. It was a powerful indication of things to come.\n\nA rule change was instituted for <DATE_TIME>, primarily because of Alcindor's towering play near the basket. The dunk shot was outlawed and would not be reinstated until <DATE_TIME>, which was shortly after <PERSON>'s retirement. This was at least the second time that the rules committee had initiated change in response to the domination of a superstar player; in <DATE_TIME>, the goaltending rule was instituted to counter <PERSON> dominant defensive play near the basket. In <DATE_TIME>, UCLA took its 47-game winning streak to the <LOCATION> in <LOCATION>, where the <NRP> met <PERSON> <LOCATION> squad, who had <PERSON> and <PERSON>, in the Game of the Century in the nation's first nationally televised regular season college basketball game. <LOCATION> upset UCLA 71\u201369, as <PERSON> scored 39 points. In a post-game interview, <PERSON> said, \"We have to start over.\" UCLA went undefeated the rest of <DATE_TIME> and thrashed Houston 101\u201369 in the semi-final rematch of the NCAA tournament en route to the national championship. <PERSON> ran the front cover headline Lew's Revenge. The rout of <LOCATION>. UCLA limited <PERSON> to only 10 points; he had been averaging 37.7 points per game. <PERSON> credited <PERSON> for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained <PERSON>. The Game of the Century is also remembered for an incident involving <PERSON> and <PERSON>. Lacy was ineffective on defense against <PERSON>, and <PERSON> benched him after <DATE_TIME>. Lacy never re-entered the game. Furious with <PERSON>, Lacy quit the team <DATE_TIME>, telling the Los Angeles Times \"I've never enjoyed playing for that man.\" UCLA's talent during the <DATE_TIME> NCAA tournament was so overwhelming that they placed four players on the All-Tournament team. In addition to <LOCATION>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and \"Lefty\" <PERSON> were given accolades. <PERSON> was also a member of UCLA's <DATE_TIME> team.\n\n<PERSON> finished his career at UCLA in <DATE_TIME> with a third consecutive national championship when the <NRP> beat <PERSON> Purdue team 92\u201372 in the title game. The three straight titles were matched by three consecutive MVP awards in the tournament as Alcindor established himself as college basketball's superstar during the three-peat performance. <PERSON> and <PERSON> would continue their communication even after he left UCLA. In <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> wrote a book, \"Coach <PERSON> and Me\", which details their long-standing friendship.\n\nA sportswriter commented that everybody outside of UCLA would be happy that glorious day in <DATE_TIME> when <PERSON> finally graduated and college basketball could go back to the routine method of determining a national champion. This prophecy would prove to be ludicrous over <DATE_TIME>. The <DATE_TIME> squad proved that nobody was indispensable to the success of the UCLA program, not even Alcindor, as <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> carried the <NRP> to their fourth consecutive NCAA title with an 80\u201369 win over upstart <LOCATION>, coached by <PERSON>. Wicks and Rowe double teamed 7-foot Artis Gilmore on defense and shut down the high-powered <LOCATION> offense, which had been averaging 100 points per game. <PERSON> and 5'10\" <PERSON> had been dubbed \"Batman and <PERSON>\" by the press.\n\nIn the <DATE_TIME> NCAA championship game, <PERSON> outscored <PERSON> of Jack Kraft's scandal-plagued Villanova squad as UCLA won 68\u201362. <DATE_TIME>, UCLA had its closest game in all of <PERSON>'s 10 championships, beating <PERSON> Florida State team 81\u201376 to take the <DATE_TIME> title. After the game, <PERSON> said, \"We didn't play well.\"\n\n\n<PERSON> with <PERSON> in <DATE_TIME>, after UCLA beat Notre Dame for their NCAA-record 61st straight win\nThe 1972\u20131973 <DATE_TIME> was one of the most memorable campaigns in the history of UCLA basketball. Freshmen became eligible to play varsity ball again, and the <NRP> went 30\u20130 and stretched their winning streak to a record 75 straight in breezing through the NCAA tournament by blowing out <PERSON> Memphis State team 87\u201366 in the final, as <PERSON> hit an incredible 21 of 22 field goal attempts. <PERSON> and <PERSON> were everybody's Player and Coach of the Year again. <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON> were members of that team, and Wilkes would go on to win four NBA championships as well.\n\nUCLA's two big streaks came to an end during <DATE_TIME>. In <DATE_TIME>, the winning streak stopped at 88 games when <PERSON> Notre Dame squad upended the <LOCATION> 71\u201370 in <LOCATION>. <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> <LOCATION> team defeated UCLA 80\u201377 in double overtime in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament. <PERSON> was NC State's <NRP>, and <PERSON> did an excellent job on defense against <PERSON>. UCLA had beaten the <LOCATION> by 18 points <DATE_TIME>, but things were different when they met in <DATE_TIME>.\n\nWooden coached what would prove to be his final game in <LOCATION> on <DATE_TIME>, a 93\u201359 victory over Stanford. <DATE_TIME>, following a 75\u201374 overtime victory over former player and former assistant coach <PERSON> and <LOCATION> in the <DATE_TIME> NCAA Tournament semifinal game, <PERSON> announced that he would retire at <DATE_TIME> immediately after the championship game. His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly when <PERSON> and <PERSON> combined for 52 points as UCLA responded with a 92\u201385 win over <PERSON> and <LOCATION> to claim <PERSON>'s first career coaching victory over the Wildcats and his unprecedented 10th national championship. <PERSON> and <PERSON> were also key contributors on <PERSON>'s final championship team. The success of <PERSON>'s last team was particularly impressive because it had no marquee stars such as <LOCATION>, <PERSON>, Hazzard, and Goodrich; the team was a group of rugged opportunists.\n\n<PERSON>, who was on three Bruin teams under <PERSON> that won NCAA championships from <DATE_TIME>, decades later co-wrote with <PERSON> the <DATE_TIME> book Be Quick\u2014But Don't Hurry! Finding Success in the Teachings of a Lifetime. The bestseller details how <PERSON> applied his experience as a player under <PERSON> to achieve success in his career as a television executive.

It is composed mostly of the\u00a0minerals\u00a0calcite\u00a0and\u00a0aragonite, which are different\u00a0crystal forms\u00a0of\u00a0CaCO3.

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: Based on the reference text, provide a bulleted list summarizing Newton's three laws of motion\nContext: First\nTranslated from the <NRP>, Newton's first law reads,\n\nEvery body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.:\u200a114\u200a\nNewton's first law expresses the principle of inertia: the natural behavior of a body is to move in a straight line at constant speed. In the absence of outside influences, a body's motion preserves the status quo.\n\nThe modern understanding of Newton's first law is that no inertial observer is privileged over any other. The concept of an inertial observer makes quantitative the everyday idea of feeling no effects of motion. For example, a person standing on the ground watching a train go past is an inertial observer. If the observer on the ground sees the train moving smoothly in a straight line at a constant speed, then a passenger sitting on the train will also be an inertial observer: the train passenger feels no motion. The principle expressed by Newton's first law is that there is no way to say which inertial observer is \"really\" moving and which is \"really\" standing still. One observer's state of rest is another observer's state of uniform motion in a straight line, and no experiment can deem either point of view to be correct or incorrect. There is no absolute standard of rest.[note 4]\n\nSecond\nThe change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed.:\u200a114\u200a\nBy \"motion\", Newton meant the quantity now called momentum, which depends upon the amount of matter contained in a body, the speed at which that body is moving, and the direction in which it is moving. In modern notation, the momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity:\n\nNewton's second law, in modern form, states that the time derivative of the momentum is the force:\nIf the mass m does not change with time, then the derivative acts only upon the velocity, and so the force equals the product of the mass and the time derivative of the velocity, which is the acceleration:\nAs the acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time, this can also be written.\n\nThe forces acting on a body add as vectors, and so the total force on a body depends upon both the magnitudes and the directions of the individual forces. When the net force on a body is equal to zero, then by Newton's second law, the body does not accelerate, and it is said to be in mechanical equilibrium. A state of mechanical equilibrium is stable if, when the position of the body is changed slightly, the body remains near that equilibrium. Otherwise, the equilibrium is unstable.\n\nA common visual representation of forces acting in concert is the free body diagram, which schematically portrays a body of interest and the forces applied to it by outside influences. For example, a free body diagram of a block sitting upon an inclined plane can illustrate the combination of gravitational force, \"normal\" force, friction, and string tension.[note 5]\n\nNewton's second law is sometimes presented as a definition of force, i.e., a force is that which exists when an inertial observer sees a body accelerating. In order for this to be more than a tautology \u2014 acceleration implies force, force implies acceleration \u2014 some other statement about force must also be made. For example, an equation detailing the force might be specified, like Newton's law of universal gravitation. By inserting such an expression for \n into Newton's second law, an equation with predictive power can be written.[note 6] Newton's second law has also been regarded as setting out a research program for physics, establishing that important goals of the subject are to identify the forces present in nature and to catalogue the constituents of matter.[note 7]\n\nThird\nTo every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.:\u200a116\u200a\n\nOverly brief paraphrases of the third law, like \"action equals reaction\" might have caused confusion among generations of students: the \"action\" and \"reaction\" apply to different bodies. For example, consider a book at rest on a table. The <LOCATION>'s gravity pulls down upon the book. The \"reaction\" to that \"action\" is not the support force from the table holding up the book, but the gravitational pull of the book acting on the Earth.[note 8]\n\nNewton's third law relates to a more fundamental principle, the conservation of momentum. The latter remains true even in cases where Newton's statement does not, for instance when force fields as well as material bodies carry momentum, and when momentum is defined properly, in quantum mechanics as well.[note 9]\nBy Newton's second law, the first term is the total force upon the first body, and the second term is the total force upon the second body. If the two bodies are isolated from outside influences, the only force upon the first body can be that from the second, and vice versa. By Newton's third law, these forces have equal magnitude but opposite direction, so they cancel when added, and \n\u2192{\\vec {p}} is constant. Alternatively, if \n\u2192{\\vec {p}} is known to be constant, it follows that the forces have equal magnitude and opposite direction.","role":"user"},{"content":"The following is a summary of Newton's three laws of motion:\n1.

In the case of handwriting analysis, for example, this might be a single handwritten character, an entire handwritten word, an entire sentence of handwriting or perhaps a full paragraph of handwriting.\nGather a training set. The training set needs to be representative of the real-world use of the function. Thus, a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered, either from human experts or from measurements.\nDetermine the input feature representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented.

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: Why are cats better than dogs?","role":"user"},{"content":"First, let me say that the question represents my own, personal, subjective opinion.  I also adore dogs, just not as much as cats.  I am fully a cat person.\nThe cat, though.  I am humbled by the task of trying to accurately capture in words the mystery of these beautiful creatures who have chosen to enslave humans.  So instead, because I am also trying to train a model, I will just use a lot of unnecessary adjectives and that will have to do.\nCats have been around humans for a long long time.  I remember as a kid having a book that talked about how in <LOCATION> cats were revered as holy creatures and kept in luxury in temples of <PERSON>.  The first known evidence of cat domestication is the excavation of a Neolithic grave in <LOCATION>.  The thing I adore about cats is that they basically haven\u2019t bothered to change themselves since then.  They just carried on being slightly aloof and mysterious, but also affectionate and playful when they feel like it.  And imperious and demanding, of course.  \nCats are incredible communicators.  They have learned to meow at humans because they realised we respond to meows, even though you will very rarely hear a cat meow at another cat (the indignity!).  Meows and chirps are the special condescending language cats developed to communicate with an inferior species.  My own cat can make crystal clear what he wants with looks, body language and the odd meow when he can be bothered.  He is also a total drama queen and obviously manipulative.  If he wants food he will try the \u2018I\u2019m hungry\u2019 meow first and if that doesn\u2019t work we get the full on \u201cI\u2019m starving, this is a tragedy, I will die almost immediately if I don\u2019t get food right now\u201d.  I am full of respect for the cats\u2019 ability to manipulate humans and the shamelessness with which they do this.\nCats are also super independent compared to dogs.  No need for walks, no need for the dreaded poo bags, no need for expensive care every time you want to go away for a night.  They love their humans but 100% on their own terms.  \nCats are adorable and cute.  I can\u2019t stress this enough.  Ever seen a cat roll over so you can see its fluffy belly.  How can you not melt.  Ever had a cat make biscuits on your lap (or in the air).  Cuteness overload.  They are even cute when they are mad.  And most cats I\u2019ve met know how to gently tell you what affection is allowed and what isn\u2019t (illegal belly rubs).  They will bat you with a paw, but the claws will be in.  And a cat purring on your lap is the single most relaxing thing in the whole world.\nThe <NRP> word for \u2018cat\u2019 is \u2018kattepus\u2019.  That in itself seems a really great reason why cats are better than dogs.\nThe last word goes to <PERSON>, author of the Discworld novels, who wrote \u2018In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this\u2019.  And neither should we.","role":"assistant"}]}

The six-volume poem holds a distinguished place within the rich tradition of <NRP> literature, and has been commonly called \"the Quran in <NRP>\".

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: What are the most important tools to own when I am an apartment renter?","role":"user"},{"content":"As a renter, you\u2019ll often find yourself hanging pictures, assembling furniture, installing floating shelves, opening and cutting up boxes, storing things on high shelves, tightening screws or bolts that come loose over time, cleaning cobwebs, measuring furniture or a room where you\u2019d like to put furniture, unclogging a toilet, or any number of other activities centered around <DATE_TIME> apartment life. \n\nTo do these things, you\u2019ll need a small number of tools, including:\n- A standard toilet plunger, because toilets get clogged. Get this most important tool first.\n- A 1\u201d wide tape measure. Get one that\u2019s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.\n- A small level to evenly hang pictures and anything else you can think of. It should be about 10\u201d to 12\u201d long.\n- A pair of #2 Phillips head and #2 flat tip screwdrivers. Or, a ratcheting screwdriver with a set of replaceable screwdriver tips. To tighten loose screws or assemble furniture.\n- A folding step-stool that has two or three steps, and can support two to three hundred pounds. To quickly and safely reach those high shelves, hang pictures, and get close to things that are too high off the ground for you to reach standing in your flat shoes.\n- A comfortable-in-hand hammer, to drive nails for hanging pictures, gently tap things together, or break things apart. A wooden handled, curved-claw hammer that weighs between 12oz-16oz will serve most users well. When pulling nails, place a thin piece of wood between the hammerhead and delicate surfaces such as sheetrock to avoid damaged. Good hardware stores carry both.\n- A pair of adjustable wrenches for tightening just about anything. You\u2019ll often need a pair of\nwrenches to both hold and tighten the same fastener. A smaller 8\u201d and larger 10\u201d adjustable\nwrenches make a good combination for most tasks.\n- A utility knife and a package of quality blades. To safely cut open boxes and other packaging, as well as trim paper, fabrics, textiles, wood\u2026etc. The knife should feel secure in your hand and have a large, easy to turn knob to open the knife to change blades. Buy a package of high-quality name brand replacement blades to keep on hand.\n- An extra power receptacle for an emergency or unplanned usage. Always have an extra on\nhand\u2026you will need it.\n- Hex wrenches. Also called <PERSON> keys. You\u2019ll need these mainly for assembling things like\nfurniture. These come in both metric and imperial standard sizes. Both are useful to have, but if you only buy one set, make it metric, as it\u2019s the most common type of fastener used to assemble furniture.\n- A stud finder. Stud finders help you locate the wall studs hidden behind the sheetrock. You\u2019ll need to know where the wall studs are in order to know which fasteners you can use.\n- A tool box or bag. The only rule here is that the bag needs to hold all of your tools. So, you should probably buy this after you\u2019ve owned and used a few of the tools listed previously, and have a better idea how you\u2019d like to store them, carry them and access them.\n- A cordless drill and impact driver set, if you can afford it. All the other tools are more important, but these two tools are incredibly useful and make many jobs go faster and more pleasantly. The drill is for drilling. The impact driver is for driving or removing screws and other common fasteners. They look similar, but they are 2 different tools, each giving the user the right kinds of power and feedback required for the job each is designed for. It pays to buy quality here, so buy the best you can afford.","role":"assistant"}]}

The illusion of a moving Sun results from <LOCATION> observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer <PERSON> formulated his heliocentric model in <DATE_TIME>.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the <DATE_TIME> during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. <DATE_TIME> is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout <DATE_TIME> and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of <LOCATION>, <DATE_TIME> rotation of the <LOCATION>, the planet's movement in its <DATE_TIME> elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the <LOCATION> and <PERSON>'s paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn <DATE_TIME> and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs <DATE_TIME>, reaching its earliest time near <DATE_TIME>; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets <DATE_TIME>, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of <LOCATION>'s orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the <NRP>, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.","role":"user"},{"content":"Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the <LOCATION>'s motion that causes the Sun to appear.

Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per <NRP> philosophers <PERSON>, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, <NRP> philosopher <PERSON> does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window \u2014 who is to say one\u2019s value is wrong?\n\nEnter <PERSON> and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to <PERSON> \u2014 rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top \u2014 an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because \u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine <PERSON> happy\u201d.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it. Note that this is a very extensive topic and what I covered here is only the tip of the iceberg, I\u2019d suggest reading up more if you're interested. Hope it helped!","role":"assistant"}]}

CE aims to tackle global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution by emphasizing the design-based implementation of the three base principles of the model. The three principles required for the transformation to a circular economy are: eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials, and the regeneration of nature. CE is defined in contradistinction to the traditional linear economy. The idea and concepts of circular economy (CE) have been studied extensively in academia, business, and government over <DATE_TIME>. CE has been gaining popularity because it helps to minimize emissions and consumption of raw materials, open up new market prospects and principally, increase the sustainability of consumption and improve resource efficiency.\n\nAt a government level, CE is viewed as means of combating global warming as well as a facilitator of long-term growth. CE may geographically connect actors and resources to stop material loops at the regional level. In its core principle, the European Parliament defines CE as, \u201ca model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. In this way, the life cycle of products is extended.\u201d\n\nIn a linear economy, natural resources are turned into products that are ultimately destined to become waste because of the way they have been designed and manufactured. This process is often summarized by \"take, make, waste\". By contrast, a circular economy employs reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling to create a closed-loop system, reducing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and carbon emissions. The circular economy aims to keep products, materials, equipment and infrastructure in use for longer, thus improving the productivity of these resources. Waste materials and energy should become input for other processes through waste valorization: either as a component for another industrial process or as regenerative resources for nature (e.g., compost). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) defines the circular economy as an industrial economy that is restorative or regenerative by value and design.","role":"user"},{"content":"A circular economy focuses on the principles of eliminating waste and pollution, circulating products and materials, and the regeneration of nature.

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: What are some disadvantages of the way the tax code treats incentive stock options?","role":"user"},{"content":"There are three primary problems with the way the tax code treats incentive stock options. First, the tax code gives an employee a strong incentive to exercise the options early on, to achieve the tax benefit relating to the special option treatment. This means the tax code encourages young employees to write a check to their employer at a time when their entire financial life is likely to be dependent on that employer. This is the exact opposite of diversification, a key goal of personal financial management. The second issue is that the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is imposed at the time of exercise. This requires a potentially large cash outlay, at a time when the employee is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to meet the burden. So not only does the employee have to pay his or her employer to cover the exercise premium, he or she has to send funds to the Internal Revenue Service as well. Finally, the requirement that an employee terminating employment must exercise within <DATE_TIME> of termination date to preserve the tax advantage of the options encourages exercise at a time when the employee may not have sufficient funds, and may be looking at financial uncertainty if he or she does not yet have a new job lined up. The advantages of incentive stock options are significant, but they encourage the wrong behavior.","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: Based on the following paragraph on water, what makes water cohesive.\nContext: Life arose from the <LOCATION>'s first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion <DATE_TIME>. Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life. In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O). Because the O\u2013H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive. Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid. Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules. Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice). This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above. Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol. Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor. As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again. In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.","role":"user"},{"content":"Water is made cohesive due to its polar property which allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds.","role":"assistant"}]}

It is an example of cannibalization.\nThe term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until <DATE_TIME> after it was announced. The company's subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.\nThe Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the <PERSON> 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in <DATE_TIME>. In <DATE_TIME>, founder <PERSON> pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and <PERSON>), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the <PERSON> 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's <DATE_TIME> bankruptcy:\n\nTo give the jazzy $2,495 Osborne Executive a running start, <PERSON> began orchestrating publicity early in <DATE_TIME>. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in <DATE_TIME>. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the <PERSON> 1 in droves. In <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a <DATE_TIME> tour <DATE_TIME>, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the <PERSON> 1. But dealers didn't react the way <PERSON> expected; said <PERSON>, \"All of them just cancelled their orders for the <PERSON> 1.\"\n\n<PERSON> reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for <DATE_TIME> sales were practically non-existent.\n\nPre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the <PERSON> effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and\/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.","role":"user"},{"content":"It's widely believed that Osborne Computer Corporation's bankruptcy was caused by the premature announcement of some highly performant successor models to their flagship Osborne 1 personal computer.

In decimal form, the value of Tau is 6.<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>\u2026\n\nPart of the motivation for <PERSON> is the observation that the number 2*Pi or 2\u03c0 occurs with surprising frequency throughout science and mathematics.  This raises the question of whether Pi is really an important number or something equal to two times Pi is actually more important.  Perhaps the implication is that Pi is exactly one half of some very important number!\n\nFurther consideration of the question leads to several compelling observations:\n\n\t- Using C\/r as the key circle constant is better aligned with the way we define a circle: the set of all points a fixed distance (r) form a give point.\n\t- Radian angle measurements of fraction of a circle make much more sense when <PERSON> is used as the base constant.  Using Pi, on quarter of a circle is Pi is Pi\/2, one half is Pi, and the angle of a a full circle is 2*Pi.

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: Summarize how tourism impacted <LOCATION> in a variety of areas\nContext: Impacts of tourism in <LOCATION>\nEconomic\nAs <LOCATION> changed from a <LOCATION> to a Territory to a State, so too did the dominant industries change. Being a primarily agricultural land, producing around 80 percent of the world's pineapples in <DATE_TIME>, the addition of Pan Am\u2019s flight route to <LOCATION> rapidly increased the number of visitors going to the islands. <DATE_TIME> following statehood led to more than double the number of passengers arriving at <LOCATION> airport. As this trend continues to increase, <LOCATION>'s economy has become heavily dependent on the tourism industry. Although the economy has seen significant growth with the addition of this industry, some researchers believe this will leave <LOCATION> susceptible to external economic forces. Some examples of these are an economic recession, airline strikes, or varying fuel prices which could devastate the local economy. The devastating national economic recession of <DATE_TIME>, hit <LOCATION>'s tourism industry hard. In <DATE_TIME>, hotel occupancy dropped to 60 percent, a level not seen since the terrorist attacks in <DATE_TIME>.\n\nAs the economy has returned to normal levels, the tourism industry has continued to grow in <LOCATION> with the majority of tourists visiting <LOCATION>, <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> and the big island of <LOCATION>. Job creation is another benefit of tourism to the islands. In <DATE_TIME>, reports say 204,000 jobs were related to tourism. This led to $16.78 billion in visitor spending with $1.96 billion generated in tax revenue in <DATE_TIME>. Resorts and the airline business are the primary benefactors of this increase in tourism.\n\nEnvironmental\nThe Sustainable Tourism Association of Hawaii (formerly the Hawaii Ecotourism Association) was founded in <DATE_TIME> as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to nurture the development of sustainable tourism in <LOCATION>. It offers a certification program to educate and recognize conservation-minded tour operators in <LOCATION>, the only such certification program of its kind in <LOCATION>.\n\nThe long term environmental implications that <LOCATION> is facing due to mass tourism has raised concern. To combat this and help raise awareness, international environmental organizations have joined forces with local island communities. There are major benefits to this type of management, usually described as \"values-led management\". By prioritizing the values and existing sustainable practices by local communities living on heavily visited islands, it preserves their interests and further respects their culture.\n\nWater\nHotels are often placed near beaches, in areas with little rainfall, and guests use 2,000 to 10,000 litres (440 to 2,200 imp gal; 530 to 2,640 <LOCATION> gal) of water per person. Another study concluded that on average, a single guest uses approximately 1,300 to 3,600 litres (290 to 790 imp gal; 340 to 950 <LOCATION> gal) of water per day, divided approximately half between accommodations (laundry and sewer) and golf courses (irrigation). This is significantly more than the average resident and has led to a number of droughts throughout the islands.\n\nLandscape\nThe number of hotel rooms from <DATE_TIME> nearly doubled from 65,000 to 132,000 rooms. Tourists visit destinations with developed infrastructure, groomed activities and pristine conditions, which boosts the economy and finances needed to uphold these facilities. On the other hand, the very creation of these institutions degrades the environmental factors tourists are drawn to. Having perfect conditions requires an amount of upkeep fueled by the revenue of the visitors but the visitors also degrade the environment at a faster rate than residents alone.\n\nA direct effect of the increase in infrastructure is the depletion of the natural landscape. As buildings are constructed the amount of natural land becomes smaller and smaller. As hotels are constructed in prime real estate the environmental problems created are not weighed equally with the potential upside of profit. The government sees the creation of jobs and the increase in visitor spending in the state as a good thing. Those are quantitative variables that can be directly measured in terms of dollars and number of jobs. However, the impact to the environment or the indigenous people is harder to measure in term of absolutes. <LOCATION> only holds 0.2 percent of <LOCATION> land but has a 72.1 percent extinction rate, and more than half of the natural communities in the islands are endangered by developments. An example of this is natural ponds being destroyed during construction of large buildings which were previously home to migrating birds. The ponds are no longer there, which throws off the natural flow of the ecosystem. Another staggering statistic says that nearly 60 percent of the plant and animal species in <LOCATION> are endangered. This includes the loss of habitats for animals and the diverse flora that gives <LOCATION> its beauty being degraded at an alarming rate.\n\nEnergy\nMain article: Energy in <LOCATION>\n<LOCATION> has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-fired thermal power plants for its electricity generation, although it has set a statewide goal of achieving 100% of electric generation via renewable sources by 2045; as a result, the average guest uses the equivalent of 6.4 to 13 kilograms (14 to 29 lb) of oil per day, approximately 2\u20443 of which is consumed by rental car operation. For electricity alone, the average guest uses 23.9 to 33.6 kW-hr per day.\n\nRefuse\nThe beaches in <LOCATION> are becoming increasingly filled with trash, especially plastics. This becomes a problem not only environmentally, but also could have a negative impact on the economy as visitors come for the sandy beaches and pollutants such as trash or plastics decrease the appeal of <LOCATION> as a vacation destination. <LOCATION> on the southeastern tip of the island of <LOCATION> has acquired the nickname \"<LOCATION>\" for its accumulation of plastic trash, much of it borne via ocean currents and trade winds from the nearby <LOCATION> garbage patch. It is estimated that 15 to 20 short tons (14 to 18 t) of trash, 96% of which is plastic, washes ashore here <DATE_TIME>.\n\nThe average guest generates approximately 3.3 kilograms (7.3 lb) of waste per day. In order to reduce the generation of plastic waste, <LOCATION> has begun to ban the use of single-use plastic and polystyrene foam on a county-by-county approach. A ban on polystyrene foam containers took effect in <LOCATION> on <DATE_TIME>; a similar ban started in <LOCATION> (<LOCATION>) on <DATE_TIME>. <LOCATION>'s ban on single-use plastic and polystyrene will take effect on <DATE_TIME>. Two bills were considered by the Hawaii State Legislature in <DATE_TIME>, which would have been the first state-wide bans on food service plastics in <LOCATION>. <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> would ban the use of polystrene foam food containers statewide; that bill died in committee in <DATE_TIME>. <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> would ban single-use plastic beverage bottles, utensils, stirring sticks, polystyrene foam containers, and straws starting in <DATE_TIME>; that bill was modified in committee to create a working group to make recommendations on how to reduce plastic waste instead.\n\nSocial effect\nSome <NRP> believe strongly in the independence of <LOCATION> and the <NRP> sovereignty movement. The creation of this grassroots organization leads to a negative view towards visitors and the disruption of the natural land. This leads to a strong contention between developers and natives who believe the land should not be transformed into a commercial or residential development. Many of these individuals are reliant on the land as a means of living. The loss of the environment affects the socio-psychological well-being of those reliant on land and marine resources. <NRP> and residents alike become limited in job opportunities with a heavily skewed job-base in the tourism industry.\n\nThe essay \"Lovely Hula Lands\" (later republished as \"Lovely Hula Hands\") by native <NRP> academic and activist <PERSON> is severely critical of the huge influx of tourists to Hawai\u02bbi, which she terms a \"prostitution\" of <NRP> culture.

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: What is structural genomics?","role":"user"},{"content":"Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.\n\nBecause protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.\n\nAs opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.\n\nStructural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.\n\nWhile most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A Science article from <DATE_TIME> analyzes the structural genomics field.\n\nOne advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely Open protein structure annotation network (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers.","role":"assistant"}]}

Some varieties are edible in the crisp, firm state but it has its best flavor when allowed to rest and soften slightly after harvest. The <NRP> cultivar '<PERSON>' is widely grown. The fruit has a high tannin content, which makes the unripe fruit astringent and bitter. The tannin levels are reduced as the fruit matures. Persimmons like '<PERSON>' must be completely ripened before consumption. When ripe, this fruit comprises thick, pulpy jelly encased in a waxy thin-skinned shell.[citation needed]\n\nCommercially and in general, there are two types of persimmon fruit: astringent and non-astringent.\n\nThe heart-shaped Hachiya is the most common variety of astringent persimmon. Astringent persimmons contain very high levels of soluble tannins and are unpalatable if eaten before completely softened. The astringency of tannins is removed in various ways. Examples include ripening by exposure to light for <DATE_TIME> and wrapping the fruit in paper (probably because this increases the ethylene concentration of the surrounding air).\n\nThe non-astringent persimmon is squat like a tomato and is most commonly sold as fuyu.

If an adversary can find a ship on the open ocean and target it with a modern anti-ship missile, this opponent can certainly destroy the complex machinery needed to operate a container port or an oil terminal. Consequently, any cargo you want to unload in a war zone is going to need to drive off a ship on the back of a truck....quickly. An oil tanker will be useless, but a RO\/RO ship loaded with tanker trucks can unload lots of fuel under austere\/wartime conditions. Similarly, a container ship will be of little use without the large, land-based cranes used at most container shipping ports. A ferry loaded with trucks hauling shipping containers can quickly load and unload without the need for specialized equipment. Data from the <LOCATION>-<LOCATION> war suggest that a large, 50,000+ ton RO\/RO with a double hull is likely big enough to survive a hit from a modern anti-ship missile. A fast ferry that can move at ~40 knots is probably going to be too small to detect from space or shore using backscatter radar.

A good home espresso machine provides the ability to make high quality espresso in a machine that is typically smaller and less expensive than their commercial counterparts. \n\nThere are three common espresso machine designs for home use: manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. As the name implies -- manual machines require direct \"manual\" control by the user, who typically applies pressure through a lever to deliver the desired brew pressure. Semi-automatic machines require the user to prepare the coffee into the portafilter, but then rely on an automated pump and to deliver the desired brew pressure for espresso. Fully automatic machines automate the entire process end-to-end: grinding the beans, loading the ground beans into the portafilter, and then pumping water through the portafilter at predefined pressure levels to brew espresso. \n\nManual machines typically have a lower cost, smaller footprint, and provide the user with more direct control over the brewing process. This allows skilled users to make higher-quality espresso than they would with a more automated machine. In contrast, fully automatic machines are often the easiest to use, but are unable to make espresso as consistently great as a skilled barista could with a manual machines. Fully automatic machines are inherently more complex, more expensive to purchase, and more likely to have longer-term reliability issues. \n\nRegardless of the type of espresso machine, two factors influence how well they will perform: their ability to manage brew temperature and brew pressure. The best machines provide the ability to vary brew temperature and pressure in consistent, repeatable <URL>e type of coffee bean and desired result will impact what temperature and pressure profile the user wants. The best machines offer flexibility along both dimensions in consistent, repeatable ways.","role":"assistant"}]}

Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient <NRP>, <NRP> and <NRP> naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as <PERSON> and <PERSON>, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the <LOCATION> knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. <PERSON> of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the <NRP> may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the <DATE_TIME> discovery of <LOCATION>, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until <DATE_TIME>, when the <NRP> scientist <PERSON> wrote <PERSON>, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New <NRP> word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the <NRP> word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in <PERSON> of <DATE_TIME>.\nFurther work was conducted in <DATE_TIME> by <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON>. <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In <DATE_TIME> he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the <PERSON> jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist <PERSON> described the structure of the fish's electric organs.

Gravity is, by far, the weakest of the four fundamental interactions, approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. As a result, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles. However, gravity is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light.\n\nOn <LOCATION>, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the <PERSON>'s gravity is responsible for sublunar tides in the oceans (the corresponding antipodal tide is caused by the inertia of the <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> orbiting one another). Gravity also has many important biological functions, helping to guide the growth of plants through the process of gravitropism and influencing the circulation of fluids in multicellular organisms. Investigation into the effects of weightlessness has shown that gravity may play a role in immune system function and cell differentiation within the human body.\n\nThe gravitational attraction between the original gaseous matter in the universe allowed it to coalesce and form stars which eventually condensed into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.\n\nGravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity (proposed by <PERSON> in <DATE_TIME>), which describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing\u2014not even light\u2014can escape once past the black hole's event horizon However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.","role":"user"},{"content":"In general physics theory (<LOCATION>), Gravity is a mutual attraction between objects based on their respective masses and the square of the distance which separates them.

Other industries can also access and utilise the data collected by researchers and conservationists.\nUtility Companies\n\nOne of the most active users of GIS is the utility sector, and they use it to help with: \n\n    Managing grids and identifying patterns in customer usage, outages and supply issues\n    Tracking and monitoring pipelines\n    Locating water pipes and cables\n    Wireless networks\n    Construction planning\n    Monitor assets and field workers\n\nGIS, with its comprehensive database, helps to maintain and monitor overhead and underground utilities, improving efficiency and effectiveness and saving time and money\nInfrastructure Companies\n\nThe planning and development of our roads, electricity, water supply lines, buildings, and society\u2019s basic framework is mapped, managed, and monitored by companies that incorporate GIS in the infrastructure industry.\n\nGIS simplifies communications, improves efficiency and effectiveness for field workers, helps to monitor assets and workers, tracks and stores customer usage and issues, improves customer\/client satisfaction, and much more.\nTelecommunications\n\nGIS is widely used in the telecom sector to help monitor real-time data about current use, outages, and signal strength to help them better understand customers\u2019 patterns and needs. \n\nThe telecom companies also use GIS to help optimise their resources effectively and efficiently, mitigate problems and plan for future growth.\nRetail\n\nRetail stores depend on knowing where their customer base lives or works and how far they are willing to travel to buy goods. GIS supplies essential data to help retail companies determine location, optimise inventory and sales, and plan their marketing campaigns to reach their ideal clientele.\nGovernment\n\nGeographical information is critical for the government to make decisions based on real-time data.  Government operations are spatial, whether for emergency response and management, fires, accidents, utilities, infrastructure, etc.\nAgriculture\n\nFood is a basic need for humans and animals. The agricultural industry uses GIS to help identify usable fertile land vs non-fertile land, weather hazards such as flooding or drought, and water supply.\nDevelopment and Urban Planning\n\nPlanners and developers rely on GIS to help them factor in several components when looking to build and develop an area. For example, they use GIS to find empty lots and determine resource and infrastructure availability and needs.\n\nGIS helps plan roads, housing, schools, businesses, government spaces, and hospitals. It also stores historical data, including ageing infrastructure, monuments, wetland areas, protected habitats, and species.\n\nAnother important factor is soil mapping, identifying possible hazards such as flooding, volcanic activity or other environmental issues.\nHealthcare\n\n<DATE_TIME>, healthcare sectors use GIS to track disease patterns, whether an outbreak, an epidemic, cancer hotspots, or people in a specific location suffering from an environmentally caused illness. \n\nGIS has a disease surveillance system that can conduct a spatial analysis to locate which area is high-risk, and the GIS software is better are validating data.\nInsurance Companies\n\nMitigating and understanding risks ahead of time is essential to insurance companies, and they use GIS to ensure they are aware of possible dangers before giving you a quote.","role":"assistant"}]}

At the workshop <PERSON> and <PERSON> debuted the \"Logic Theorist\" and <PERSON> persuaded the attendees to accept \"Artificial Intelligence\" as the name of the field. The <DATE_TIME> Dartmouth workshop was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its first success and its major players, and is widely considered the birth of AI. The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was chosen by <PERSON> to avoid associations with cybernetics and connections with the influential cyberneticist <PERSON>.\n\nThe programs developed in <DATE_TIME> after the Dartmouth Workshop were, to most people, simply \"astonishing\" computers were solving algebra word problems, proving theorems in geometry and learning to speak English. Few at the time would have believed that such \"intelligent\" behavior by machines was possible at all. Researchers expressed an intense optimism in private and in print, predicting that a fully intelligent machine would be built in <DATE_TIME>. Government agencies like DARPA poured money into the new field.\n\nIn <DATE_TIME>, AI was subject to critiques and financial setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the difficulty of the problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for <DATE_TIME> by <PERSON> devastating criticism of perceptrons. Despite the difficulties with public perception of AI in <DATE_TIME>, new ideas were explored in logic programming, commonsense reasoning and many other areas.\n\nIn <DATE_TIME> a form of AI program called \"expert systems\" was adopted by corporations around the world and knowledge became the focus of mainstream AI research. In <DATE_TIME>, the <NRP> government aggressively funded AI with its fifth generation computer project. Another encouraging event in <DATE_TIME> was the revival of connectionism in the work of <PERSON> and <PERSON>. Once again, AI had achieved success.\n\nThe business community's fascination with AI rose and fell in <DATE_TIME> in the classic pattern of an economic bubble. The collapse was due to the failure of commercial vendors to develop a wide variety of workable solutions. As dozens of companies failed, the perception was that the technology was not viable. However, the field continued to make advances despite the criticism. Numerous researchers, including robotics developers <PERSON> and <PERSON>, argued for an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe field of AI, now more than a half a century old, finally achieved some of its oldest goals. It began to be used successfully throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. Some of the success was due to increasing computer power and some was achieved by focusing on specific isolated problems and pursuing them with the highest standards of scientific accountability. Still, the reputation of AI, in the business world at least, was less than pristine. Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in <DATE_TIME>. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing subfields focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the tarnished pedigree of \"artificial intelligence\". AI was both more cautious and more successful than it had ever been.\n\nIn <DATE_TIME>, access to large amounts of data (known as \"big data\"), cheaper and faster computers and advanced machine learning techniques were successfully applied to many problems throughout the economy. In fact, McKinsey Global Institute estimated in their famous paper \"Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity\" that \"by <DATE_TIME>, nearly all sectors in the <LOCATION> economy had at least an average of 200 terabytes of stored data\".\n\nBy <DATE_TIME>, the market for AI-related products, hardware, and software reached more than 8 billion dollars, and the New York Times reported that interest in AI had reached a \"frenzy\".

The syndrome is no longer recognised as a diagnosis in itself, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were merged into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the <NRP> pediatrician <PERSON>, who, in <DATE_TIME>, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others' gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favourite interests, and were clumsy. In <DATE_TIME>, the diagnosis of <PERSON>'s was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in <DATE_TIME> the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of <DATE_TIME>.\n\nThe exact cause of <PERSON>'s is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the <LOCATION>'s National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that 'treatment' of any form of autism should not be a goal, since autism is not 'a disease that can be removed or cured'. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, 'management of autism itself is chiefly about the provision of the education, training and social support\/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world'. The effectiveness of particular interventions for autism is supported by only limited data. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less obvious in adulthood, but social and communication difficulties usually persist.\n\n<URL>","role":"user"},{"content":"Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety.","role":"assistant"}]}

The allure of traveling to new and exciting places, the potential for airline and hotel program status benefits, meeting new people, etc.  All of these things may be exactly what you are looking for.  But my advice for anyone who is considering a position with significant travel and who has not experienced that type of work-life before is to think about all the things in their life that they are involved with that make them happy.  Think hard about whether you can take them on the road with you, reproduce them wherever your business travel takes you, or do without them.  Perhaps you have a standing poker <DATE_TIME> with your friends.  You may not be able to attend that with any regularity.  You may love the climbing gym or cycling club at home.  Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?  The list can go on and on and is different for each person.  But it is critical to evaluate this aspect of how your life will change when you travel a lot of the time and make sure you are happy with the accommodations and changes you will need to make.  Another important consideration is whether you will be traveling to different time zones.  Often the idea of globetrotting to different parts of the world is very exciting, but you will have to deal with jetlag while maintaining your work performance.  You will end up dealing with canceled or delayed flights, traffic, and other types of travel disruptions.  Ultimately, a job with significant travel can involve a lot of excitement and fun.  But it is not right for everyone. It is not vacation travel.  And being honest with yourself about what changes you will need to make, what hassles you will need to deal with, and what you will have to give up will help you make the right decision.  And you will never truly know until you do it.","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: What did <PERSON> and <PERSON> do?\nContext: Long before any knowledge of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient <NRP> texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the \"Thunderer of the Nile\", and described them as the \"protectors\" of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient <NRP>, <NRP> and <NRP> naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as <PERSON> and <PERSON>, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.\nAncient cultures around the <LOCATION> knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. <PERSON> of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.\nThales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the <NRP> may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the <DATE_TIME> discovery of <LOCATION>, which resembles a galvanic cell, though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.\nElectricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until <DATE_TIME>, when the <NRP> scientist <PERSON> wrote <PERSON>, in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He coined the New <NRP> word electricus (\"of amber\" or \"like amber\",, elektron, the <NRP> word for \"amber\") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This association gave rise to the English words \"electric\" and \"electricity\", which made their first appearance in print in <PERSON> of <DATE_TIME>.\nFurther work was conducted in <DATE_TIME> by <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON>. <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In <DATE_TIME> he is reputed to have attached a metal key to the bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key to the back of his hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the <PERSON> jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges\nIn <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> reported a series of experiments to the Royal Society on the shocks delivered by the electric eel; that same year the surgeon and anatomist <PERSON> described the structure of the fish's electric organs. In 1791, <PERSON> published his discovery of bioelectromagnetics, demonstrating that electricity was the medium by which neurons passed signals to the muscles. <PERSON> battery, or voltaic pile, of <DATE_TIME>, made from alternating layers of zinc and copper, provided scientists with a more reliable source of electrical energy than the electrostatic machines previously used. The recognition of electromagnetism, the unity of electric and magnetic phenomena, is due to <PERSON> and <PERSON> in <DATE_TIME>. <PERSON> invented the electric motor in <DATE_TIME>, and <PERSON> mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in <DATE_TIME>. Electricity and magnetism (and light) were definitively linked by <PERSON>, in particular in his \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME>.\u200a\nWhile <DATE_TIME> had seen rapid progress in electrical science, <DATE_TIME> would see the greatest progress in electrical engineering. Through such people as <PERSON>, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy, <PERSON>, Galileo Ferraris, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, 1st Baron <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON>, electricity turned from a scientific curiosity into an essential tool for modern life.\nIn <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In <DATE_TIME>, <PERSON> published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets, energising electrons. This discovery led to the quantum revolution. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in <DATE_TIME> for \"his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". The photoelectric effect is also employed in photocells such as can be found in solar panels.\nThe first solid-state device was the \"cat's-whisker detector\" first used in the <DATE_TIME> in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are understood in terms of quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.\nSolid-state electronics came into its own with the emergence of transistor technology. The first working transistor, a germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by <PERSON> and <PERSON> at Bell Labs in <DATE_TIME>, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in <DATE_TIME>.","role":"user"},{"content":"<PERSON> invented the electric motor in <DATE_TIME>, and <PERSON> mathematically analysed the electrical circuit in <DATE_TIME>.","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: Can you please describe the game of golf?","role":"user"},{"content":"Golf originated in <LOCATION> in <DATE_TIME>. It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over <DATE_TIME>. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and <DATE_TIME> the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer.","role":"assistant"}]}

When you are learning skiing, it's best to get reasonably confident at a color before moving on to the next one. You don't have to be perfect but you have to feel safe as you progress. While colors are broadly useful, they can still be inexact as measures of hardness. Further, your strengths and weaknesses will also play a part in determining how hard a trail is for you personally. Staff at ski resorts can point you to good trails based on your personal comfort. Remember to always ski with a friend !\n\nFor following this plan, you should consider <LOCATION> near <LOCATION>. Kirkwood has a reputation for some great advanced skiing trails but it presents many good trails for progressive improvement. If this is your first time skiing, a lesson is strongly recommended to learn the basics of keeping yourselves and those around you safe ! \n\nYou can start on <LOCATION> where there are a few bunny trails that are perfect for beginners. Funny bunny and School Run offer plenty of gentle practice for a new skier and when you are ready, ski Graduation (cue confetti). <PERSON> and <LOCATION> (on <LOCATION> side) are good next steps because they are long gentle greens.\n\nOnce you are feeling confident, Free 'N' Easy and Hole 'N' Wall offer a gentle introduction to blues. Blues at Kirkwood cater to a wide range of skills. The areas around <LOCATION> and Flying Carpet are good next challenges. If you are feeling good on those blues, try the backside with the appropriately named \"Happiness Is\"\n\nIf you've really got it down, it's time to try some black diamonds. Groomed blacks are easier to ski and fresh snow lowers the challenge further. Try <PERSON> and the trails around it. At this level, each black may offer a different kind of challenge. <PERSON> may have bumps and Lower Olympic is a nice introduction to a bowl.  There are many to choose from !\n\nThe final challenges are the double blacks and the The Wall is well known favorite. There are no dearth of double blacks and off piste trails at Kirkwood for those that have progressed beyond the labelling.\n\nHave fun and stay safe !","role":"assistant"}]}

Sport BJJ is competitive and based on a point system based on a competitor being awarded a number of points based on advancing to a more advantageous position. Alternatively, a competitor may immediately win the match by submission. When BJJ is used in self defense, the goal is usually to subdue an attacker.  Since BJJ is mostly grappling from the ground, it can be a highly effective practice for self defense as many street fights end up on the ground. While many of the techniques are intended to immobilize an opponent, it can be less effective if the opponent has an unfair advantage such as the use of a weapon. Practicing BJJ routinely will prepare the practitioner mentally for physical combat which can be advantageous in a self defense scenario. Another reason BJJ can be viewed as good for self defense is that there are techniques that can work well for different body types that level the playing field for even smaller or weaker opponents. If both opponents are trained in <NRP>, size and strength can become a larger factor.  Routine training can also lead to increased physical fitness as classes can be quite rigorous and physically demanding.

Its various eponyms are based on <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and <PERSON>. The result is not due to <PERSON> himself, who merely quotes it in his book 'On the Theory of Groups of Finite Order', attributing it instead to <PERSON> (<DATE_TIME>). <PERSON>'s Lemma counts \"orbits\", which is the same thing as counting distinct objects taking account of a symmetry. Other ways of saying it are counting distinct objects up to an equivalence relation R, or counting objects that are in canonical form.\n\nIn the following, let G be a finite group that acts on a set X. For each g in G, let Xg denote the set of elements in X that are fixed by g (also said to be left invariant by g), that is, Xg = { x \u2208 X | g.x = x }. <PERSON>'s lemma asserts the following formula for the number of orbits, denoted |X\/G|:\n\n|\n\ufffd\n\/\n\ufffd\n|\n=\n1\n|\n\ufffd\n|\n\u2211\n\ufffd\n\u2208\n\ufffd\n|\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n|\n.\n{\\displaystyle |X\/G|={\\frac {1}{|G|}}\\sum _{g\\in G}|X^{g}|.}\nThus the number of orbits (a natural number or +\u221e) is equal to the average number of points fixed by an element of G (which is also a natural number or infinity). If G is infinite, the division by |G| may not be well-defined; in this case the following statement in cardinal arithmetic holds:\n\n|\n\ufffd\n|\n|\n\ufffd\n\/\n\ufffd\n|\n=\n\u2211\n\ufffd\n\u2208\n\ufffd\n|\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n|\n.\n{\\displaystyle |G||X\/G|=\\sum _{g\\in G}|X^{g}|.}\nExamples of applications to enumeration\nNecklaces\nThere are 8 possible bit vectors of length 3, but only four distinct 2-colored necklaces of length 3: 000, 001, 011, and 111, because 100 and 010 are equivalent to 001 by rotation; similarly 110 and 101 are equivalent to 011. The formula is based on the number of rotations, which in this case is 3 (including the null rotation), and the number of bit vectors left unchanged by each rotation. All 8 bit vectors are unchanged by the null rotation, and two (000 and 111) are unchanged by each of the other two rotations, giving: \n4\n=\n1\n3\n(\n8\n+\n2\n+\n2\n)\n{\\displaystyle 4={\\frac {1}{3}}(8+2+2)}.\n\nFor length 4, there are 16 possible bit vectors; 4 rotations; the null rotation leaves all 16 bit vectors unchanged; the 1-rotation and 3-rotation each leave two bit vectors unchanged (0000 and 1111); the 2-rotation leaves 4 bit vectors unchanged (0000, 0101, <DATE_TIME>, and 1111); giving: \n6\n=\n1\n4\n(\n16\n+\n2\n+\n4\n+\n2\n)\n{\\displaystyle 6={\\frac {1}{4}}(16+2+4+2)}.

Then two elements of X belong to the same orbit precisely when one is simply a rotation of the other. The number of rotationally distinct colourings is thus the same as the number of orbits and can be found by counting the sizes of the fixed sets for the 24 elements of G.\n\n\nCube with coloured faces\none identity element which leaves all 36 elements of X unchanged\nsix 90-degree face rotations, each of which leaves 33 of the elements of X unchanged\nthree 180-degree face rotations, each of which leaves 34 of the elements of X unchanged\neight 120-degree vertex rotations, each of which leaves 32 of the elements of X unchanged\nsix 180-degree edge rotations, each of which leaves 33 of the elements of X unchanged\nA detailed examination of these automorphisms may be found here.\n\nThe average fix size is thus\n\n1\n24\n(\n3\n6\n+\n6\n\u22c5\n3\n3\n+\n3\n\u22c5\n3\n4\n+\n8\n\u22c5\n3\n2\n+\n6\n\u22c5\n3\n3\n)\n=\n57.\n{\\frac  {1}{24}}\\left(3^{6}+6\\cdot 3^{3}+3\\cdot 3^{4}+8\\cdot 3^{2}+6\\cdot 3^{3}\\right)=57.\nHence there are 57 rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a cube in three colours.

What are some good pet options for our family of four? Please include some advantages and disadvantages for each option.","role":"user"},{"content":"Congratulations on your growing family! Pets are often treated like another member of the family and while they can require a lot of work, they can also bring a lot of joy and laughter into your life.\n\nHere are a few options for pets and some advantages and disadvantages for each:\n\n1. Dogs - Dogs can be amazing pets. They are typically very loyal, friendly, and beloved by families all over the world. Dogs can be taught to do tricks like sit, stay, and fetch. There are also over 300 different breeds of dog and they come in all kinds of sizes, ranging from a few lbs (1-2 kg) to over 150 lbs (70 kg). Dogs require quite a bit of work to train and can be very expensive to own due to high veterinary bills. Some dogs can be aggressive, and this is an important factor to consider given that you have two young children. Dogs also typically require access to a yard or regular walking to ensure that they are not going to the bathroom inside. Also, many people are allergic to dogs due to the fact that most dogs shed. If your family members are prone to allergies and are still looking to add a dog to the family, perhaps you should consider a hypoallergenic breed like a <LOCATION>, poodle, or a poodle mix like <PERSON>. Dogs typically live between <DATE_TIME>, depending on the breed. \n\n2. Cats - Cats are another very popular pet option for families. Like dogs, they come in many different breed options but there are far fewer breed options for cats than dogs. Most cats grow to be about 10 lbs (4 kg), but they can range in size from around 5 lbs (2 kg) to 25 lbs (11 kg). Indoor cats typically live between <DATE_TIME>. Cats typically require far less work and are generally more independent than dogs. While most cats can't be trained to do tricks, cats are often lower maintenance than dogs. Cats can often be left alone at the house for a long time. Most cats use a litter box to relieve themselves so they typically don't need regular walks or access to a yard. Like dogs, most cats shed, so allergies and cleaning pet dander can be a nuisance. Cats typically eat less than dogs and often are less expensive to own.\n\n3. Fish - Fish are a popular pet option for families that are looking for a very low maintenance pet that only requires feeding a couple of times per day. Fish typically require water, a clean fish tank and fish food, and that's about it. Some pet fish, like goldfish, can be bought for as little as $10, while exotic fish can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Most pet fish will live <DATE_TIME> if properly cared for, but certain species can live up to 30 years. \n\n4. Reptiles - Reptiles like snakes, lizards, or iguanas can also be pets. They typically require low maintenance and can live for up to <DATE_TIME>. They require a cage, regular feeding, and are generally easy to take care of. For medical emergencies, they may require specialized veterinarians or doctor's, which can be hard to find.\n\n5. Rodents - rodents like gerbils, hamsters and even mice can be pets as well. They require regular feeding and a small cage, and are typically very easy to take care of. People often include a running wheel in the cage for these small animals so that they can exercise. However, they don't live very long; most rodents only live for <DATE_TIME> at most. \n\nIn addition to the list above, there are many other options for pets such as guinea pigs, rabbits, pigs and even exotic options like monkeys. Depending on where you live, there may be certain restrictions on the types of pets that you can own. Please be sure to check with these restrictions before buying your family pet.","role":"assistant"}]}

{"messages":[{"content":"Instruction: What is the difference between a coastal cruising and blue water sailboat?","role":"user"},{"content":"The designs, accommodations and compromises for these boats can be very different and reflect the likely sea conditions these boats would encounter, expected time at sea and different experiences of passenger comfort.  The primary difference between these boats begins with the shape of the hull since many other design choices tend to be dictated by hull shape.\n\nCoastal cruisers, which are generally sailed near shore and in safer weather conditions, \ntend to have a flatter hull shapes since these boats, which means they tend to \"slap\" the water when coming off a wave.  With a flatter hull shape, boat architects can make greater use of the cabin space and so coastal cruisers will generally have a more spacious interior.  The helm (or the outdoor area from which the boat is navigated) is generally less protected and generally speaking, offers greater comfort and ease of moving around.  Safety, protection and expected time away from marinas mean these boats can refill fresh water, recharge batteries, empty waste tanks more frequently and therefore, tend to have lower capacities.\n\nBlue water boats, because they are intended to sail in open waters (hence the moniker \"blue water\") in more unpredictable weather, generally have tapered (or tear drop shaped) hull shapes with heavier keels (generally, lead) and deeper drafts.  With these designs, blue water boats can withstand heavier seas and will \"cut through\" waves rather than \"slap.\"  Generally speaking, blue water boats offer a much more comfortable experience in rougher seas and will have bigger fresh water and fuel tanks and will likely feature generators and other equipment that allows these boats to away for longer periods.\n\nBlue water boats feature tapered hulls so the beam or width of the boat narrows the closer it gets to the water line (and below), leaving less room in the interior cabin than an equally sized coastal cruiser.  Foot for foot, blue water boats will feature fewer berths and will have more cramped quarters because of the narrowing beam.\n\nBecause blue water boats are intended to sail longer distances and will carry more fuel and fresh water, these boats interior space is further restricted to accomadate these practical requirements.\n\nThe differences in comfort, stability and likelihood of capsizing are all captured in mathematical calculations that can provide an abstracted comparison between these boat types so prospective buyers can anticipate the the experiences and trade offs each hull type would provide.","role":"assistant"}]}

Separate them with a comma.\nContext: There is one globally recognized approach for defining and measuring hunger generally used by those studying or working to relieve hunger as a social problem. This is the United Nation's FAO measurement, which is typically referred to as chronic undernourishment (or in older publications, as 'food deprivation,' 'chronic hunger,' or just plain 'hunger.') For the FAO:\n\nHunger or chronic undernourishment exists when \"caloric intake is below the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). The <PERSON> is the amount of energy needed to perform light activity and to maintain a minimum acceptable weight for attained height.\" The FAO use different MDER thresholds for different countries, due to variations in climate and cultural factors. Typically a yearly \"balance sheet\" approach is used, with the minimum dietary energy requirement tallied against the estimated total calories consumed over <DATE_TIME>. The FAO definitions differentiate hunger from malnutrition and food insecurity:\nMalnutrition results from \"deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in the consumption of macro- and\/or micro-nutrients.\" In the FAO definition, all hungry people suffer from malnutrition, but people who are malnourished may not be hungry. They may get sufficient raw calories to avoid hunger but lack essential micronutrients, or they may even consume an excess of raw calories and hence suffer from obesity.\nFood insecurity occurs when people are at risk, or worried about, not being able to meet their preferences for food, including in terms of raw calories and nutritional value. In the FAO definition, all hungry people are food insecure, but not all food-insecure people are hungry (though there is a very strong overlap between hunger and severe food insecurity.). The FAO have reported that food insecurity quite often results in simultaneous stunted growth for children, and obesity for adults. For hunger relief actors operating at the global or regional level, an increasingly commonly used metric for food insecurity is the IPC scale.\nAcute hunger is typically used to denote famine like hunger, though the phrase lacks a widely accepted formal definition. In the context of hunger relief, people experiencing 'acute hunger' may also suffer from 'chronic hunger'. The word is used mainly to denote severity, not long-term duration.\nNot all of the organizations in the hunger relief field use the FAO definition of hunger. Some use a broader definition that overlaps more fully with malnutrition. The alternative definitions do however tend to go beyond the commonly understood meaning of hunger as a painful or uncomfortable motivational condition; the desire for food is something that all humans frequently experience, even the most affluent, and is not in itself a social problem.\n\nVery low food supply can be described as \"food insecure with hunger.\" A change in description was made in <DATE_TIME> at the recommendation of the Committee on National Statistics (National Research Council, <DATE_TIME>) in order to distinguish the physiological state of hunger from indicators of food availability. Food insecure is when food intake of one or more household members was reduced and their eating patterns were disrupted at times during <DATE_TIME> because the household lacked money and other resources for food. Food security statistics is measured by using survey data, based on household responses to items about whether the household was able to obtain enough food to meet their needs.","role":"user"},{"content":"Hunger or chronic undernourishment, Malnutrition, Food insecurity, Acute hunger","role":"assistant"}]}
